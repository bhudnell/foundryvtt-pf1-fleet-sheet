- More than 6 Squadrons are hard to see as the window size needs to be adjusted. (sources tab on items has similar problem and uses second row to fix it)
- module setting to set the profession sailor tag (default to "sailor")
- pass DC to Moral Check Roll (this should be possible since v12 at least for skills and saves, probably can be adapted for morale checks)
- Allow rearrangement of squadrones via drag and drop (similar to sources)
- boons that affect squadrons cant affect the same squadron twice
- admirals and commodores must be unique
- put below behind "strict mode" setting
    - boons that are only 1 per fleet are enforced
    - books that affect squadrons cant affect the same squadron twice
    - admirals and commodores are all unique
